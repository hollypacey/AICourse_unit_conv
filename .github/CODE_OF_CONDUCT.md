# Contributor Code of Conduct

The purpose of this repository is to teach workshop attendees how to be effective team members when 
developing code collaboratively.
Behaviour is expected to be appropriate for the professional academic and pedagogical context.

If the code of conduct is not adhered to, the matter should be referred to the students' institution for resolution.
